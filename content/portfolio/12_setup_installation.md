# üõ†Ô∏è Hands-On Services: Practical Tech Installations

Alongside my digital expertise, I also bring a practical touch to physical tech installations. 

- **Meeting Room Setup:** For conferencing, my preference is for Logitech equipment. It strikes a good balance between price and performance and is compatible with all mainstream platforms such as Meet, Teams and Zoom. I can wall mount TVs, cameras and neatly cable all necessary equipment.

- **Security Installations:** My services extend to setting up small-scale security solutions. This includes the installation of smart doorbells and network video cameras.

- **Network Hardware Installations:** As long as you don't need me to flood wire an entire building, I can do small quantity CAT5 cable runs, terminated in either patch panels or RJ45 wall sockets. 

- **Neat Computer Setups:** When it comes to setting up computer equipment, I believe in a tidy workspace. I'll set up your computers, monitors, and peripherals not just for optimal use but also with neatness and order in mind.

Let‚Äôs roll up our sleeves and get to work!
