# The Problem-Solving Technologist with a Passion for People and Variety

Since diving into the IT world in 1999 and embracing the freelance journey in 2011, **I've carved out a niche as a versatile "general practitioner" in technology.** My love for variety means I thrive on the diverse challenges and projects that come my way, from streamlining complex processes to teaching tech skills. There's no typical day in my life, and that's just how I like it!

#### Turning Complexity into Simplicity
One of my greatest joys is transforming what seems complex into something beautifully simple. Like the time recently where I replaced an entire manual process with a Google Sheet, a dash of code and Data Studio – not only saving a client from hiring an extra hand but also enhancing their website with an interactive dashboard. **It's about seeing beyond the conventional, finding clarity where others see complexity.**

#### A Unique Perspective
I've never been one to simply follow the crowd. Take this website, for example. Countless IT support company websites are filled with technobabble, stock photography, and generic images of people in suits or in offices, either laughing or staring intently at laptop screens. I wanted my website to stand out from that mold. There's a nostalgic part of me that fondly recalls my early interactions with technology—think ZX Spectrums, BBC model Bs, and Atari STs. That's why I chose a retro theme and pixel art for my site.

This distinct way of thinking isn't just about aesthetics; it reflects how I approach business. By thinking outside the box, I generate unique ideas and solutions tailored to the specific needs of each client.

#### Just-in-Time Knowledge
I firmly believe in "just-in-time" knowledge—learning what's needed at the moment, applying it effectively, and then moving on to the next challenge. This approach allows me to stay agile and adaptable, always ready to tackle new and complex problems without getting bogged down by unnecessary details.

#### A People Person with a Natural Teaching Ability
I'm a natural teacher. I excel at breaking down complex concepts into understandable steps. My ability to demystify technology and make it accessible has literally **saved careers**.


#### My Unique Selling Point: Diplomacy with a Dash of Realness
What truly sets me apart is my combination of people skills and technical expertise. I'm diplomatic, straightforward, and committed to what's genuinely best for my clients. I have a knack for communicating complex technical concepts in simple terms, making me a trusted advisor to those I work with. My approach is always people-first, tech-second – because at the end of the day, **it's not just about solving tech problems; it's about helping people.**
