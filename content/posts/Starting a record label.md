# What If Someone Offered Me a Bunch of Money to Start a Record Label?

I love music. I always have. I love listening to it, writing it, recording it, and self-publishing it. But I’m also realistic enough to know that nobody is desperately waiting to hear songs written by a guy in his fifties recording from his family home. That’s not a complaint, it’s just how culture works. Cool matters. Context matters. Image matters.

This problem isn’t new. Frank Farian faced it decades ago, which is why he created Boney M and later Milli Vanilli. He understood that great songs still need the right faces, voices, energy, and machinery behind them to reach an audience. So here’s the thought experiment that kicked all of this off: what if someone offered me serious money to release music, but not my music. Music created and performed by young, credible, exciting musicians, supported by people who understand modern discovery, streaming, physical sales, merchandise, and live performance. What would a record label built properly in 2026 actually look like?

This is my answer.

# Rationale: Reasons for Project Choices

![pixelart](/images/rationale.webp)

## 1. Introduction

This document explains the reasons behind the key decisions made in the project plan. These include how the band is chosen, how the music is produced, how it is marketed, and why the project focuses on one band and one release.

The decisions are based on current music industry practices and research into how emerging artists are supported today.

---

## 2. Rationale for Focusing on One Band

The project focuses on signing one band rather than multiple artists in order to keep the project realistic and manageable.

Supporting one band allows the budget to be used more effectively and ensures that enough time and attention is given to recording quality and promotion.

Using a band instead of a solo artist also helps reduce costs, as there is less need to hire session musicians. Bands are also well suited to live performance, which supports promotion and audience engagement.

---

## 3. Rationale for Artist Discovery Methods

**TikTok** and **Instagram** were chosen as the main platforms for discovering the band because they are widely used by young musicians and audiences.

These platforms allow artists to share:
- Performance videos  
- Original songs  
- Behind-the-scenes content  

This can be done without needing professional resources.

An open submission process was chosen to make the opportunity accessible and fair. Asking for self-recorded performance videos reflects how artists are often discovered in the real world, where labels and promoters assess talent online before arranging live performances.

---

## 4. Rationale for the Production Approach

Professional studio recording was chosen to ensure the final release meets industry standards. While home recording is common, studio recording provides:
- Higher sound quality  
- Experienced engineering support  
- A more reliable final result  

Producing a mini-album rather than a full album balances creativity with time and budget limits. An eight-track release provides enough material to introduce the band while remaining realistic within a three-month schedule.

---

## 5. Rationale for the Marketing Strategy

The marketing strategy focuses mainly on social media because this is how new music is commonly discovered today.

Platforms such as:
- TikTok  
- Instagram  
- YouTube Shorts  

allow artists to reach new audiences quickly through short, engaging videos.

The use of performance clips and behind-the-scenes content helps the band appear authentic and relatable, which is important for building a fanbase.

Paid advertising is used in a limited way to support organic reach rather than replace it.

Radio promotion is not a main focus because traditional radio has less influence on emerging artists compared to digital platforms. However, independent and online radio stations can still help reach niche audiences.

---

## 6. Rationale for the Release Strategy

Releasing singles before the full mini-album helps build interest and maintain audience attention.

This approach allows listeners to become familiar with the band before the main release.

Offering limited physical products such as vinyl and merchandise supports direct sales and fan engagement. Physical products are often treated as special or collectible items rather than mass-market products, which helps reduce financial risk.

---

## 7. Rationale for the Three-Month Timeline

A three-month timeline was chosen to keep the project focused and maintain momentum.

Shorter release cycles reflect modern music consumption habits, where audiences expect regular content and updates.

The timeline also allows enough time for recording, promotion, and release preparation without delaying the project unnecessarily.

---

## 8. Conclusion

The decisions made in this project aim to balance creativity, realism, and industry relevance.

By focusing on one band, using modern discovery and marketing platforms, and following a structured release plan, the project reflects how emerging artists are launched in today’s music industry.

---

## Budget and Financial Rationale

![pixelart](/images/budget.webp)

## 1. Introduction

This document explains the budget for the project and the reasons for each cost.  
The budget is based on realistic prices from UK music industry services, including professional recording studios, mixing engineers, and mastering services. The aim is to show an understanding of how much it costs to produce and release music to a professional standard.

---

## 2. Recording Costs

The band will record in a professional UK recording studio with an experienced engineer. Using a professional studio helps ensure good sound quality and makes the recording process more efficient.

A mid-range studio is chosen rather than a very high-end studio to keep costs controlled while still achieving professional results.

**Estimated cost:**

- 8 days of studio recording at approximately £400 per day

**Total recording cost:** **£3,200**

---

## 3. Mixing Costs

After recording, the tracks will be mixed by a professional mixing engineer. Mixing balances the instruments and vocals and prepares the tracks for release.

Professional mixing engineers in the UK typically charge per track. A mid-range rate has been chosen to reflect good quality without using very high-profile engineers.

**Estimated cost:**

- 8 tracks at £200 per track

**Total mixing cost:** **£1,600**

---

## 4. Mastering Costs

Mastering is the final stage of audio production and ensures the music sounds consistent and polished across streaming platforms and physical formats.

A recognised professional mastering service will be used, such as Abbey Road’s online mastering service. This ensures the final audio meets industry standards.

**Estimated cost:**

- 8 tracks at £90 per track

**Total mastering cost:** **£720**

---

## 5. Artwork and Photography Costs

Visual content is important for promoting music online and for physical products. A professional photoshoot and album artwork will be created.

**Estimated cost:**

- Photography: £500  
- Artwork design: £300  

**Total artwork and photography cost:** **£800**

---

## 6. Marketing and Promotion Costs

Marketing focuses mainly on social media platforms such as TikTok and Instagram.

### Digital Distribution

A music distribution service is required to release the music on streaming platforms.

- Distribution fee: **£50**

### Social Media Advertising

A small budget is set aside for paid advertising to help promote singles and reach new listeners.

- Advertising budget: **£800**

### Press and Playlist Promotion

Some budget is allocated to promote the release through independent radio stations, blogs, and playlists.

- Promotion budget: **£1,000**

---

## 7. Physical Products

### Vinyl Production

A limited run of vinyl records will be produced as a collector item and sold directly to fans.

- Estimated cost for 300 records: **£2,250**

### Merchandise

Basic merchandise such as t-shirts and stickers will be produced for online sales and the launch event.

- Merchandise cost: **£800**

---

## 8. Total Project Budget

| Category | Cost |
|--------|------|
| Recording | £3,200 |
| Mixing | £1,600 |
| Mastering | £720 |
| Artwork & Photography | £800 |
| Marketing & Promotion | £1,850 |
| Vinyl Production | £2,250 |
| Merchandise | £800 |
| **Total Budget** | **£11,220** |

---

## 9. Budget Reasoning

This budget focuses on spending money where it has the most impact. Professional recording, mixing, and mastering ensure the music meets industry standards. Marketing costs focus on social media, where emerging artists are most likely to be discovered.

Risk is reduced by:

- Working with one band only  
- Producing a mini-album instead of a full album  
- Limiting the amount of physical stock produced  

This makes the project realistic and achievable for a first release.

---

## 10. Conclusion

The budget reflects realistic costs for producing and releasing music in today’s industry. It balances quality, promotion, and cost control, and supports the overall aim of launching one emerging band successfully.

The idea is to support one emerging band through recording, release, and promotion of a mini-album.  
The focus is on realistic, modern music industry practices.

---

## Slide 2 — The Idea

### Speaker Notes

Many young bands struggle to get their music heard because professional recording and marketing are expensive.  
They also often don’t understand how releases are planned or promoted.  

This project aims to give one band a structured and professional first release, with industry support.

---

## Slide 3 — Why One Band

### Speaker Notes

This project focuses on signing one band rather than multiple artists.  
This keeps the project manageable and allows the budget to be spent on quality rather than quantity.  

Using a band instead of a solo artist also reduces costs because session musicians are not needed.  
It lowers risk and makes the project more realistic.

---

## Slide 4 — How We Find the Band

The band will be found using platforms that young musicians already use.  
An open submission will be advertised on **TikTok** and **Instagram**.

The main platforms used will be:
- TikTok  
- Instagram  
- YouTube Shorts  

Content will include short performance clips, behind-the-scenes studio footage, and song previews.  
A small amount of paid advertising will be used to increase reach.

---

## Slide 7 — Release Plan

The release will be spread out to keep audience interest.  

One single will be released first, followed by a second single closer to the album release.  
The mini-album will then be released digitally.  

Limited vinyl and merchandise will be sold online, and a launch concert will support the release.

---

## Slide 8 — Budget Overview

### Speaker Notes

The total budget for the project is just over eleven thousand pounds.  
This includes recording, mixing, mastering, artwork, marketing, vinyl production, and merchandise.  

The figures are based on real UK studio and service costs rather than estimates.

---

## Slide 9 — How Money Is Made

### Speaker Notes

Income will mainly come from:
- Vinyl sales  
- Merchandise  
- Ticket sales from the launch concert  

Streaming income is expected to be smaller at first but may grow over time as the audience increases.  
This approach prioritises direct-to-fan sales, which are more reliable for new artists.

### Speaker Notes
