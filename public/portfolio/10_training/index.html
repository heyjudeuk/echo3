<p><strong>Personalized Tech Coaching:</strong> My forte is in guiding those who find technology challenging, helping them become adept and self-assured in its use. The digital world is vast, filled with various software packages, mobile and desktop apps, and web-based SaaS platforms. While some, like me, can quickly adapt to new software, I understand that not everyone shares this ease. Many people, talented in other areas, might find technology a bit daunting, especially when it&rsquo;s an essential part of their job. My strength lies in rapidly absorbing new tech knowledge and effectively passing it on to others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Focus on Productivity Tools:</strong> I have the most experience with productivity software, especially the Microsoft and Google suites. Whether you&rsquo;re new to these platforms or looking to enhance your skills, I can tailor training sessions to your needs. But my expertise doesn&rsquo;t stop there – given a specific scope, I can prepare and deliver training for a wide range of software or even a combination of different tools.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Training for Real-World Application:</strong> This is particularly beneficial for onboarding new team members, ensuring they&rsquo;re equipped with the necessary skills for their roles right from the start.</p>
