      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-if-someone-offered-me-a-bunch-of-money-to-start-a-record-label&#34;&gt;What If Someone Offered Me a Bunch of Money to Start a Record Label?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love music. I always have. I love listening to it, writing it, recording it, and self-publishing it. But I’m also realistic enough to know that nobody is desperately waiting to hear songs written by a guy in his fifties recording from his family home. That’s not a complaint, it’s just how culture works. Cool matters. Context matters. Image matters.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-if-someone-offered-me-a-bunch-of-money-to-start-a-record-label&#34;&gt;What If Someone Offered Me a Bunch of Money to Start a Record Label?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love music. I always have. I love listening to it, writing it, recording it, and self-publishing it. But I’m also realistic enough to know that nobody is desperately waiting to hear songs written by a guy in his fifties recording from his family home. That’s not a complaint, it’s just how culture works. Cool matters. Context matters. Image matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This problem isn’t new. Frank Farian faced it decades ago, which is why he created Boney M and later Milli Vanilli. He understood that great songs still need the right faces, voices, energy, and machinery behind them to reach an audience. So here’s the thought experiment that kicked all of this off: what if someone offered me serious money to release music, but not my music. Music created and performed by young, credible, exciting musicians, supported by people who understand modern discovery, streaming, physical sales, merchandise, and live performance. What would a record label built properly in 2026 actually look like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-plan&#34;&gt;The Plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-project-overview&#34;&gt;1. Project Overview&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project involves identifying, signing, producing, and releasing a mini-album by one emerging band over a three-month period. The record label will manage artist discovery, selection, recording, marketing, distribution, and release activities using current industry-standard platforms and methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-artist-discovery-and-selection-process&#34;&gt;2. Artist Discovery and Selection Process&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The band will be identified through a structured artist discovery process combining social media scouting and an open submission campaign. An open call for submissions will be launched across TikTok and Instagram for a two-week period. These platforms are selected because they are the primary discovery tools for new music in 2026 and are widely used by young bands to promote original material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artists will be invited to submit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A short self-taped live performance video (home recording or rehearsal space).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One original recorded track (demo quality acceptable).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Links to active social media accounts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A brief artist biography.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Submissions will be collected using an online form and reviewed by the label team. Shortlisted bands may be invited to submit additional live footage or attend a short audition performance if geographically feasible. Selection will be based on songwriting quality, performance ability, consistency of online engagement, and readiness to commit to the project timeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-project-roles-and-responsibilities&#34;&gt;3. Project Roles and Responsibilities&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The record label will act as project manager and executive producer, overseeing scheduling, budgeting, production coordination, marketing planning, and distribution. The band will be responsible for delivering original material, attending rehearsals and recording sessions, creating social media content, and participating in promotional activity including live performance and interviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;4-pre-production-phase&#34;&gt;4. Pre-Production Phase&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once signed, the band will enter a structured pre-production phase. During this period, the band will rehearse selected songs to a professional standard. A final track list of eight songs will be agreed, and arrangements will be locked to reduce studio inefficiencies. Tempo mapping, structure confirmation, and reference track discussions will take place to ensure clarity before recording begins. A detailed studio schedule will be produced to maximise productivity and control costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;5-recording-and-post-production&#34;&gt;5. Recording and Post-Production&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recording will take place in a professional studio environment. Core instruments will be tracked first, followed by vocals and overdubs. Sessions will be supervised by a producer or engineer to maintain quality control. After recording, all tracks will undergo editing, mixing, and professional mastering to ensure consistency across streaming platforms and physical formats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;6-marketing-strategy-and-promotion-methods&#34;&gt;6. Marketing Strategy and Promotion Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marketing activity will follow a digital-first strategy, reflecting how new artists are promoted in the current music industry. The band’s primary platforms will be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TikTok:&lt;/strong&gt; short-form performance clips, behind-the-scenes studio footage, song hooks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instagram:&lt;/strong&gt; Reels, Stories, release announcements, audience interaction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YouTube Shorts:&lt;/strong&gt; performance excerpts and music video clips.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A content schedule will be created to ensure regular posting during the three-month campaign. The band will be supported in creating authentic, performance-focused content rather than traditional advertising-style posts. Paid social media advertising will be used selectively on TikTok and Instagram to promote singles and drive traffic to streaming platforms. Radio promotion will be limited to targeted independent and online stations that support emerging artists. The focus will be on niche exposure rather than mainstream national radio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;7-release-strategy&#34;&gt;7. Release Strategy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The release strategy will follow a staggered approach:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First single released during post-production to introduce the band.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second single released closer to the album launch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mini-album released digitally at the end of month three.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physical products including vinyl and merchandise will be offered via pre-order through the band’s website and social media platforms. A launch concert will be held to support the release and generate additional promotional content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;8-distribution-and-sales-channels&#34;&gt;8. Distribution and Sales Channels&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digital distribution will be managed through an online distributor to deliver music to major streaming platforms. Direct-to-fan sales will be prioritised using:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Band website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social media shop features.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On-site sales at the launch performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach allows the label to manage revenue flow and audience data more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;9-project-timeline-three-months&#34;&gt;9. Project Timeline (Three Months)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Month One:&lt;/strong&gt; Artist discovery, signing, rehearsals, and studio recording.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Month Two:&lt;/strong&gt; Editing, mixing, mastering, artwork creation, and first single release.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Month Three:&lt;/strong&gt; Ongoing promotion, second single release, digital album release, and launch performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;10-project-completion&#34;&gt;10. Project Completion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project concludes when the mini-album has been released digitally, physical products are available, promotional activity has been completed, and the launch performance has taken place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-this-approach-rationale&#34;&gt;Why this approach? (Rationale)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-introduction&#34;&gt;1. Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This rationale explains the reasoning behind the key decisions made in the project plan, including artist selection methods, production approach, marketing strategy, release structure, and overall project scope. The decisions are based on current industry practices for developing emerging artists and releasing music in a digital-first environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-rationale-for-selecting-one-band&#34;&gt;2. Rationale for Selecting One Band&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision to sign one band rather than multiple artists was made to ensure focus, quality control, and effective use of resources. Managing a single band allows the label to dedicate sufficient time and budget to production, marketing, and artist development. It also reduces complexity and risk, particularly for a first release. Choosing a band rather than a solo artist reduces the need for additional session musicians, lowering recording costs and simplifying scheduling. Bands also offer stronger live performance opportunities, which support promotional activity and audience engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-rationale-for-artist-discovery-methods&#34;&gt;3. Rationale for Artist Discovery Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social media platforms, particularly TikTok and Instagram, were selected as the primary artist discovery tools because they are currently the most influential platforms for new music discovery among younger audiences. These platforms allow artists to demonstrate performance ability, originality, and audience engagement without requiring professional-level resources. An open submission process ensures accessibility and fairness while also enabling the label to assess commitment, organisation, and consistency from potential artists. The use of self-recorded performance videos reflects real-world industry practices, where labels increasingly rely on online content to identify talent before arranging live auditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;4-rationale-for-the-production-approach&#34;&gt;4. Rationale for the Production Approach&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project uses a professional studio recording process to ensure the final product meets industry standards for streaming and physical formats. Pre-production planning is prioritised to reduce studio time and control costs, which reflects common industry practice for independent labels. Producing a mini-album rather than a full-length album balances creative output with time and budget constraints. An eight-track release provides enough material to establish the band’s identity while remaining realistic within a three-month schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;5-rationale-for-the-marketing-strategy&#34;&gt;5. Rationale for the Marketing Strategy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The marketing strategy follows a digital-first approach, reflecting how emerging artists are promoted in the current music industry. Short-form video platforms are prioritised because they enable organic discovery, audience interaction, and rapid content distribution. Focusing on performance clips, behind-the-scenes footage, and storytelling content allows the band to present an authentic image rather than relying solely on traditional advertising. Paid social media advertising is used selectively to amplify reach rather than replace organic engagement. Radio promotion is limited to independent and online stations that support new artists. This reflects the reduced influence of traditional radio for emerging acts compared to streaming platforms and social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;6-rationale-for-the-release-strategy&#34;&gt;6. Rationale for the Release Strategy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A staggered release strategy is used to maintain audience interest over time. Releasing singles before the full mini-album allows the band to build momentum, test audience response, and generate streaming activity ahead of the main release. Offering limited physical products such as vinyl and merchandise supports direct-to-fan engagement and provides higher-margin revenue opportunities. This approach reflects current trends in independent music releases, where physical formats are often used as collector items rather than mass-market products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;7-rationale-for-the-three-month-timeline&#34;&gt;7. Rationale for the Three-Month Timeline&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three-month timeline balances speed and quality. A shorter timeline maintains momentum and relevance, while structured phases ensure sufficient time for production, promotion, and release preparation. This schedule reflects the fast-paced nature of modern music consumption, where extended release cycles can reduce audience engagement for emerging artists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;8-conclusion&#34;&gt;8. Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project plan has been designed to reflect realistic, current industry practices while remaining achievable within the given constraints. The choices made prioritise focus, efficiency, artist development, and audience engagement. This approach provides a practical and sustainable model for launching an emerging band through a modern independent record label.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;budget-and-financial-rationale&#34;&gt;Budget and Financial Rationale&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This document sets out the project budget accompanied by clear reasoning based on actual studio and audio service pricing in the UK music industry in 2026. All figures are researched from publicly available services and representative cost ranges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-production-budget&#34;&gt;1. Production Budget&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a) Recording Studio (Professional Tier)&lt;/strong&gt;
To produce a professional-quality album, it is important to select a studio that provides high-quality recording spaces, experienced engineers, and reliable gear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option 1 — Mid-range UK studios:&lt;/strong&gt; Examples include independent studios that charge daily or hourly rates for recording sessions. Typical UK studios charge between £25 to £150 per hour, with full-day rates typically from £100 to £500 per day depending on quality and location.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Estimated cost for 8 days at a mid-range studio focused on band recording:&lt;/strong&gt; 8 days @ £400/day = &lt;strong&gt;£3,200&lt;/strong&gt;. This includes use of the recording room, microphones, professional engineer support, and basic tracking. Examples of studios in this category include Arena Recording Studio, which lists full-day recording around £300–£325 with engineer support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option 2 — High-tier iconic studio (e.g., Abbey Road):&lt;/strong&gt; Abbey Road Studios in London is world-renowned and appropriate for professional finished recordings. Prices vary greatly depending on room and engineer selection, but day rates at top facilities can range from several thousand pounds per day for large rooms and full teams. For budget purposes we do not use Abbey Road daily hire in the base budget but reference it here for context.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;b) Mixing&lt;/strong&gt;
Mixing is usually charged per track by freelance audio engineers or in-studio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mid-level engineers and small studios typically charge around £150–£350 per track in the UK.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Higher-end London services can charge £300–£800+ per track depending on engineer reputation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For an 8-track mini-album, a realistic mid-range budget is: 8 tracks @ £200 = &lt;strong&gt;£1,600&lt;/strong&gt;. This ensures a professional mix suitable for both streaming and vinyl masters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;c) Mastering&lt;/strong&gt;
Mastering prepares the final mix for distribution. Pricing varies based on engineer reputation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High-quality mastering services (including top studios such as Abbey Road’s online mastering) start around £90 per track (excluding VAT).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other professional UK mastering studios (e.g., London Mastering Studio) list rates around £75 per track.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For budgeting purposes: 8 tracks @ £90 = &lt;strong&gt;£720&lt;/strong&gt;. This allows a high-standard master provided by established mastering engineers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;d) Artwork and Photography&lt;/strong&gt;
Professional visual assets are important for digital platforms and physical products:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Photoshoot with photographer: £500 (approximate market rate for a branded session).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Album artwork: £300.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total artwork &amp;amp; photography&lt;/strong&gt; = &lt;strong&gt;£800&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Production Subtotal:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;th style=&#34;text-align: left&#34;&gt;Category&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th style=&#34;text-align: left&#34;&gt;Cost&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left&#34;&gt;Recording Studio&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left&#34;&gt;£3,200&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left&#34;&gt;Mixing&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left&#34;&gt;£1,600&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left&#34;&gt;Mastering&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left&#34;&gt;£720&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left&#34;&gt;Artwork &amp;amp; Photography&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left&#34;&gt;£800&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total Production&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;£6,320&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-marketing-and-release-budget&#34;&gt;2. Marketing and Release Budget&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a) Digital Distribution&lt;/strong&gt;
A music distributor (e.g., DistroKid, CD Baby or similar) charges a year-fee to release music on streaming platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distribution fee (annual) = &lt;strong&gt;£50&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;b) Social Media Advertising&lt;/strong&gt;
Paid social campaigns on TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube Shorts support single and album promotion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TikTok &amp;amp; Instagram ads = &lt;strong&gt;£800&lt;/strong&gt;. This budget drives pre-saves, streaming traffic, and follower growth using platform-specific ad tools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;c) PR, Playlist &amp;amp; Press Outreach&lt;/strong&gt;
Targeted outreach to independent radio, blogs, and playlists increases visibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PR service = &lt;strong&gt;£1,000&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;d) Vinyl Production (Limited Run)&lt;/strong&gt;
Pressing a limited run of vinyl supports direct-to-fan sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For example, pressing around 300 copies (basic weight and packaging) is typically in the £2,000–£2,500 range depending on pressing plant and options offered.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vinyl pressing = &lt;strong&gt;£2,250&lt;/strong&gt; (mid-point estimate).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;e) Merchandise (T-shirts + Stickers)&lt;/strong&gt;
Basic band merchandise for online and live sales:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Merch production = &lt;strong&gt;£800&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marketing &amp;amp; Release Subtotal:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;th style=&#34;text-align: left&#34;&gt;Category&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th style=&#34;text-align: left&#34;&gt;Cost&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left&#34;&gt;Distribution&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left&#34;&gt;£50&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left&#34;&gt;Advertising&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left&#34;&gt;£800&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left&#34;&gt;PR&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left&#34;&gt;£1,000&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left&#34;&gt;Vinyl pressing&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left&#34;&gt;£2,250&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left&#34;&gt;Merchandise&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left&#34;&gt;£800&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total Marketing &amp;amp; Release&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;£4,900&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;

      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;4-financial-reasoning&#34;&gt;4. Financial Reasoning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Realistic Service Costs:&lt;/strong&gt; The recording budget reflects professional but not top-tier studio time: studios in the UK typically charge £25–£150 per hour or £100–£500 per day, with more experienced engineer support at the higher end. Mixing and mastering reflect current UK ranges: mixing £150–£350+ per track and mastering £75+ per track from reputable studios (including Abbey Road’s online mastering at approx £90/track).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Balanced Investment:&lt;/strong&gt; This budget prioritises professional sound quality and effective marketing, while controlling costs through careful selection of mid-range services rather than premium daily rates at legendary studios (e.g., full Abbey Road room hire at £10,000+ per day).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Direct-to-Fan Revenue Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Physical products such as vinyl and merchandise generate higher margins and support direct sales outside streaming revenue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;5-risk-management&#34;&gt;5. Risk Management&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The budget assumes efficient studio scheduling and prioritises online services (e.g., online mastering) where appropriate to deliver professional results with a controlled spend. These cost estimates align with current UK industry ranges and are defensible in an educational or investor context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;investor-pitch-nextwave-records&#34;&gt;Investor Pitch: NextWave Records&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SLIDE 1 — TITLE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NextWave Records:&lt;/strong&gt; A modern record label for emerging bands.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pitch focus:&lt;/strong&gt; Launching one high-potential band using a proven, modern release model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SLIDE 2 — THE OPPORTUNITY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Young bands struggle to access professional recording and marketing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Traditional labels are high-risk and slow to invest in new acts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Artists often lack industry knowledge and financial support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The opportunity:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Digital platforms allow new artists to be discovered quickly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fans increasingly support artists directly through vinyl and merch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A focused, low-risk model can launch new talent effectively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SLIDE 3 — THE SOLUTION (OUR MODEL)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NextWave Records offers:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short-term, project-based deals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Professional production and release support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Digital-first marketing with direct-to-fan sales.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key principle:&lt;/strong&gt; Focus on one band, one release, done properly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This reduces risk while maximising quality and impact.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SLIDE 4 — HOW WE FIND TALENT (MODERN A&amp;amp;R)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Artist discovery is TikTok-first:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open submission campaign on TikTok and Instagram.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Self-recorded performance videos and demos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Active social media presence required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why this works:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Artists prove performance ability and audience engagement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low cost, high reach.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflects real-world A&amp;amp;R practices in 2026.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SLIDE 5 — PROFESSIONAL PRODUCTION (CREDIBILITY)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recording:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Professional UK studio (mid-range band-focused facility).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experienced engineer and producer oversight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mixing:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Freelance professional mixing engineers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Typical UK rates: £150–£350 per track.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mastering:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Professional mastering services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Example: Abbey Road Studios online mastering.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Approx. £90 per track (industry-standard quality).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Result:&lt;/strong&gt; A release that meets professional industry expectations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SLIDE 6 — MARKETING &amp;amp; RELEASE STRATEGY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digital-first promotion:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Performance clips, studio footage, storytelling content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Release structure:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two singles before album launch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mini-album released digitally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limited vinyl and merch for direct sales.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supporting activity:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Targeted ads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Independent radio and playlist outreach.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Live launch performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SLIDE 7 — FINANCIAL OVERVIEW&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total project budget:&lt;/strong&gt; £11,220&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost breakdown:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Production: £6,320&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marketing &amp;amp; release: £4,900&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key strengths:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Controlled costs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No long-term artist contracts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Physical products increase early revenue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SLIDE 8 — REVENUE POTENTIAL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Primary income streams:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vinyl sales (limited run).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Merchandise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Launch show ticket sales.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secondary income:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Streaming (long-term growth).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brand partnerships and live bookings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investor benefit:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Faster cost recovery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scalable model for future releases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SLIDE 9 — WHY THIS WORKS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focused investment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modern discovery methods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Professional production standards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Realistic, industry-aligned costs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong artist development without long-term risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is not a gamble.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is a controlled launch model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SLIDE 10 — THE ASK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are seeking investment to:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fund production and marketing of the first release.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Establish NextWave Records as a launch platform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prove the model for future signings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outcome:&lt;/strong&gt; A professionally released band with growth potential and a repeatable label framework.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-introduction--philosophy&#34;&gt;1. Introduction &amp;amp; Philosophy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Core Problem:&lt;/strong&gt; The author is a musician in his fifties who acknowledges he lacks the &amp;ldquo;cool&amp;rdquo; factor and cultural context required for modern success, despite loving to write and record.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Frank Farian&amp;rdquo; Precedent:&lt;/strong&gt; References the creator of Boney M and Milli Vanilli, who understood that great songs need the right faces, voices, and machinery to reach an audience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Experiment:&lt;/strong&gt; A proposal to use serious funding to launch a record label properly built for 2026, releasing music by young, credible musicians rather than the author.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;overview--roles&#34;&gt;Overview &amp;amp; Roles&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective:&lt;/strong&gt; Identify, sign, produce, and release a mini-album by one emerging band over a three-month period.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Label Role:&lt;/strong&gt; Project manager and executive producer (scheduling, budgeting, marketing, distribution).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Band Role:&lt;/strong&gt; Deliver original material, record, perform, and create social content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;artist-discovery-month-1&#34;&gt;Artist Discovery (Month 1)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Method:&lt;/strong&gt; Structured scouting via social media and an open submission campaign.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Platforms:&lt;/strong&gt; TikTok and Instagram (identified as primary discovery tools in 2026).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Submission Requirements:&lt;/strong&gt; Self-taped live performance video, one original demo track, social media links, and a bio.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selection Criteria:&lt;/strong&gt; Songwriting quality, performance ability, consistency of engagement, and readiness to commit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;production-month-1&#34;&gt;Production (Month 1)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pre-Production:&lt;/strong&gt; Rehearsing selected songs to a professional standard; locking in an 8-song tracklist to reduce studio waste.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recording:&lt;/strong&gt; Professional studio environment; core instruments tracked first, followed by vocals/overdubs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Post-Production:&lt;/strong&gt; Professional editing, mixing, and mastering to ensure consistency across formats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;marketing-strategy-digital-first&#34;&gt;Marketing Strategy (Digital-First)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content:&lt;/strong&gt; Focus on short-form video (TikTok, Reels, YouTube Shorts) featuring performance clips and behind-the-scenes footage rather than traditional ads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paid Media:&lt;/strong&gt; Selective paid ads to drive traffic to streaming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Radio:&lt;/strong&gt; Limited to niche independent/online stations; no mainstream national radio focus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;release--distribution-months-2--3&#34;&gt;Release &amp;amp; Distribution (Months 2 &amp;amp; 3)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategy:&lt;/strong&gt; Staggered release (Single 1 -&amp;gt; Single 2 -&amp;gt; Mini-Album).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Formats:&lt;/strong&gt; Digital distribution to major streaming platforms; physical products (vinyl/merch) sold direct-to-fan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Channels:&lt;/strong&gt; Band website, social media shops, and on-site sales at the launch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Launch Event:&lt;/strong&gt; A live concert to generate promotional content and support the release.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;3-strategic-rationale&#34;&gt;3. Strategic Rationale&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single Band Focus:&lt;/strong&gt; Ensures quality control, maximizes resources, and reduces risk compared to signing multiple acts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Band vs. Solo Artist:&lt;/strong&gt; Bands remove the need for hiring session musicians and offer stronger live performance potential.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Media Discovery:&lt;/strong&gt; Allows the label to verify performance ability and audience engagement cheaply before investing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8-Track Mini-Album:&lt;/strong&gt; Balances sufficient creative output with time and budget constraints (realistic for a 3-month timeline).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3-Month Timeline:&lt;/strong&gt; Short enough to maintain momentum and relevance in a fast-paced market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recording:&lt;/strong&gt; 8 days at a mid-range professional studio (£400/day) = £3,200.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mixing:&lt;/strong&gt; 8 tracks @ £200/track (Freelance engineers) = £1,600.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mastering:&lt;/strong&gt; 8 tracks @ £90/track (e.g., Abbey Road Online) = £720.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>How to Stop Spam Meeting Invites from Cluttering Your Outlook Calendar</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/how-to-stop-spam-meeting-invites/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 07 Jul 2025 14:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/how-to-stop-spam-meeting-invites/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been getting spammy meeting invitations appearing in your Outlook calendar, you’re not alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a growing nuisance: spammers have discovered that sending calendar invitations can bypass traditional email filters and force their junk straight onto your schedule. Worse, if you decline these invitations, you confirm your email address is valid, potentially inviting more spam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do you prevent this in Microsoft 365? It’s surprisingly tricky—Outlook’s default behaviour is to automatically add new meeting requests as tentative appointments, whether you accept them or not. For most people, this feature was meant to be helpful. But recently, it has become a liability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been getting spammy meeting invitations appearing in your Outlook calendar, you’re not alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a growing nuisance: spammers have discovered that sending calendar invitations can bypass traditional email filters and force their junk straight onto your schedule. Worse, if you decline these invitations, you confirm your email address is valid, potentially inviting more spam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do you prevent this in Microsoft 365? It’s surprisingly tricky—Outlook’s default behaviour is to automatically add new meeting requests as tentative appointments, whether you accept them or not. For most people, this feature was meant to be helpful. But recently, it has become a liability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at why this happens, what you can (and can’t) configure, and the cleanest way to stop it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-do-invitations-automatically-appear-in-my-calendar&#34;&gt;Why Do Invitations Automatically Appear in My Calendar?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This behaviour comes from Outlook’s &lt;code&gt;AutomateProcessing&lt;/code&gt; setting. In simple terms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AutoUpdate&lt;/strong&gt; (the default) means new meeting requests create tentative appointments in your calendar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AutoAccept&lt;/strong&gt; means the system will automatically accept or decline based on availability (mostly used for resource mailboxes like meeting rooms).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;None&lt;/strong&gt; disables automatic processing entirely, leaving the invitations as emails you must accept manually.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there is no separate toggle just to turn off tentative entries for normal user mailboxes—Microsoft never implemented that. You either get automatic processing (and auto-added tentative meetings) or you don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;can-i-turn-off-auto-adding-invitations-in-outlook-settings&#34;&gt;Can I Turn Off Auto-Adding Invitations in Outlook Settings?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In classic Outlook and older versions of Outlook Web App (OWA), there used to be a checkbox called “Automatically add invitations to my calendar.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in the modern Outlook on the web and the “New Outlook” experience, this option often no longer appears in settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has led many administrators and users to assume it’s impossible to change, but the good news is that you can still disable it via PowerShell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-solution-disabling-automatic-processing-via-powershell&#34;&gt;The Solution: Disabling Automatic Processing via PowerShell&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re an Office 365 administrator, you can run a simple command to stop spam invites from appearing in calendars automatically. Here’s how:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell&lt;/strong&gt;
Open PowerShell and run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-powershell&#34; data-lang=&#34;powershell&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Connect-ExchangeOnline -UserPrincipalName youradmin@yourdomain.com
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disable automatic processing for the user mailbox&lt;/strong&gt;
Replace &lt;code&gt;user@yourdomain.com&lt;/code&gt; with the affected mailbox:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-powershell&#34; data-lang=&#34;powershell&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Set-CalendarProcessing -Identity user@yourdomain.com -AutomateProcessing None
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verify&lt;/strong&gt;
Run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-powershell&#34; data-lang=&#34;powershell&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Get-CalendarProcessing -Identity user@yourdomain.com | fl AutomateProcessing
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should see:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;AutomateProcessing : None
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disconnect your session&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-powershell&#34; data-lang=&#34;powershell&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Disconnect-ExchangeOnline
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-changes-when-you-disable-automateprocessing&#34;&gt;What Changes When You Disable AutomateProcessing?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you set &lt;code&gt;AutomateProcessing&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No more tentative appointments—meeting invites stay as emails until the user accepts them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No auto-accept or decline—the user decides.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No automatic updates or cancellations—the user must process all meeting changes manually.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the trade-off: you gain control over what goes on the calendar, but you lose automatic updates to existing events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-doesnt-microsoft-just-let-us-turn-off-tentative-entries&#34;&gt;Why Doesn’t Microsoft Just Let Us Turn Off Tentative Entries?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a common frustration. The short answer is: historical design decisions. The “auto-tentative” feature was meant to help users avoid missing meetings. Over time, Microsoft has never split this into a separate toggle for user mailboxes. If you want to avoid tentative spam, disabling &lt;code&gt;AutomateProcessing&lt;/code&gt; entirely remains the only supported method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;final-thoughts&#34;&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your users are seeing a flood of calendar spam, this simple PowerShell command can bring relief. Just be sure they understand the side-effect: everything must be processed manually from their Inbox. For most people, this is a small price to pay for keeping their schedule clean.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Entra ID Joined, But Not an Admin? Fixing the “SID with a Question Mark” Issue on Windows 11</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/entraid-joined-but-not-admin/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/entraid-joined-but-not-admin/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve recently unboxed a brand-new Windows 11 Pro laptop, gone through the out-of-box experience (OOBE), signed in with a work or school account, and found that the device successfully joined Entra ID — only to discover that the user has no local admin rights — you’re not alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even worse, when checking the local Administrators group, you may see a strange SID beginning with S-1-12-1&amp;hellip; and a greyed-out question mark. No name. No permissions. And no way to elevate. In other words: a fully joined but unusable device.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve recently unboxed a brand-new Windows 11 Pro laptop, gone through the out-of-box experience (OOBE), signed in with a work or school account, and found that the device successfully joined Entra ID — only to discover that the user has no local admin rights — you’re not alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even worse, when checking the local Administrators group, you may see a strange SID beginning with S-1-12-1&amp;hellip; and a greyed-out question mark. No name. No permissions. And no way to elevate. In other words: a fully joined but unusable device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what’s going on — and how to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;-the-problem&#34;&gt;🧠 The Problem&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, the first user to join a Windows device to Azure AD (now Entra ID) is automatically added to the local Administrators group. But recently, Microsoft changed the default behaviour in new 365 tenants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result: the joining user gets a partial profile and a broken admin assignment, seen as a SID with no resolvable name. The OS knows the user exists (they can sign in!), but cannot elevate them — and you can’t install software, update drivers, or even reset Windows without an admin password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;-what-causes-it&#34;&gt;🕵️‍♂️ What Causes It?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The root cause is nearly always Entra ID device settings or Intune policies that block or fail to assign local admin rights. Specifically:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;✅ Check This Setting:
Go to Entra ID Admin Centre → Devices → Device Settings&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under &amp;ldquo;Local administrator settings&amp;rdquo;, ensure &amp;lsquo;Registering user is added as local administrator on the device during Microsoft Entra join&amp;rsquo; is set to All and &amp;lsquo;Global administrator role is added as local administrator on the device during Microsoft Entra join&amp;rsquo; is set to Yes (this is useful).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/20250620/entra-id-join-as-admin.png&#34; alt=&#34;Screen shot of EntraID Entra join settings under devices&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;-how-to-fix-it&#34;&gt;🛠️ How to Fix It&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you already have a device in this broken state — i.e. no admin users — you have a few options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option 1: Reset and Try Again (with Correct Settings)&lt;/strong&gt;
If you’re early in deployment and don’t mind starting over:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use Shift + Restart at the login screen → Troubleshoot → Reset this PC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ensure internet is available throughout OOBE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confirm your Entra ID tenant settings (see above) allow the joining user to become a local admin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🔐 If BitLocker is enabled, make sure the recovery key is in Entra ID before wiping&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option 2: Use Intune to Assign Admin Rights Remotely&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the device is enrolled in Intune, push a script or configuration profile to fix it without wiping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PowerShell Script via Intune&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-powershell&#34; data-lang=&#34;powershell&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Add-LocalGroupMember -Group &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Administrators&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; -Member &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;AzureAD\user@domain.com&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deploy this via Endpoint Manager → Devices → Scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;-conclusion&#34;&gt;🧩 Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This issue is frustrating, especially when it leaves you with a fully joined but locked-down device. Fortunately, the fix is straightforward once you know where to look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key takeaway: Microsoft’s default behaviour has shifted. If you’re managing devices via Entra ID and Intune, double-check your tenant and deployment profile settings to avoid this silent gotcha.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fix: Xero and Web Pages Not Loading on Toob Broadband</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/xero-and-other-sites-not-loading-on-toob-braodband/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 28 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/xero-and-other-sites-not-loading-on-toob-braodband/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fix: Xero and Web Pages Not Loading on Toob Broadband&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, a client approached me with a peculiar problem: web apps like Xero, Bankline, and Tesco wouldn’t fully load on their Windows 11 laptop using Chrome or Edge. Refreshing the browser sometimes resolved the issue, but it wasn’t reliable. He told me that the problem started after switching his ISP from Virgin to Toob. After troubleshooting—clearing the browser cache, disabling extensions and ad-blockers, and resetting the network stack—I turned to Google and discovered a Reddit thread (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/Southampton/comments/19c2vrm/anyone_else_having_connectivity_issues_with_toob/&#34;&gt;link here&lt;/a&gt;) that described someone with exactly the same issue. He suggested changing the MTU to 1280; implementing this fix resolved my client’s issue entirely.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fix: Xero and Web Pages Not Loading on Toob Broadband&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, a client approached me with a peculiar problem: web apps like Xero, Bankline, and Tesco wouldn’t fully load on their Windows 11 laptop using Chrome or Edge. Refreshing the browser sometimes resolved the issue, but it wasn’t reliable. He told me that the problem started after switching his ISP from Virgin to Toob. After troubleshooting—clearing the browser cache, disabling extensions and ad-blockers, and resetting the network stack—I turned to Google and discovered a Reddit thread (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/Southampton/comments/19c2vrm/anyone_else_having_connectivity_issues_with_toob/&#34;&gt;link here&lt;/a&gt;) that described someone with exactly the same issue. He suggested changing the MTU to 1280; implementing this fix resolved my client’s issue entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is MTU and Why Does it Matter?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) defines the maximum size of a data packet that can be sent over your network. If the MTU size is too large for your internet connection, it can cause packet fragmentation or drops, leading to incomplete data transfer. This can result in web pages failing to load correctly or web apps behaving erratically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some networks, especially those with VPNs, certain ISPs (like Toob), or firewalls, an MTU setting that’s too high can cause these connectivity issues. Reducing the MTU is often a simple fix that ensures data packets are small enough to travel without being fragmented. Why 1280? I found subsequent threads on Reddit that claim Toob support have stipulated 1280, which is also the minimum allowed by IPv6. I checked his router interface and found that the MTU for both IPv4 and IPv6 were both set to &amp;lsquo;auto&amp;rsquo;.If the router negotiates an MTU size of 1280, Windows’ default MTU of 1500 can cause packet fragmentation for outgoing traffic. This is generally not an issue for basic browsing if data received from webservers via the router is in smaller packets than Windows is configured to handle. However, for interactive web applications like Xero, which involve bidirectional communication, fragmentation of outbound traffic can interfere with critical processes like HTTPS or TLS handshakes. This can cause issues such as incomplete page loading or erratic app behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-to-set-the-mtu-to-1280-on-windows&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Set the MTU to 1280 on Windows&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow these steps to adjust the MTU size on a Windows 10 or 11 laptop:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open Command Prompt as Administrator&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press &lt;code&gt;Win + S&lt;/code&gt; and type “Command Prompt”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right-click on &lt;strong&gt;Command Prompt&lt;/strong&gt; and select “Run as administrator”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find Your Network Adapter Name&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Command Prompt, type:
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;netsh interface ipv4 show subinterfaces
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press Enter. You’ll see a list of network adapters. Look for the one you’re using (e.g., Wi-Fi or Ethernet).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set the MTU Size&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the following command to set the MTU to 1280:
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;netsh interface ipv4 set subinterface &amp;#34;&amp;lt;Adapter Name&amp;gt;&amp;#34; mtu=1280 store=persistent
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replace &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Adapter Name&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; with the name of your network adapter. For example:
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;netsh interface ipv4 set subinterface &amp;#34;Wi-Fi&amp;#34; mtu=1280 store=persistent
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verify the Change&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run the following command to confirm the MTU has been updated:
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;netsh interface ipv4 show subinterfaces
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check that the MTU for your adapter now shows 1280.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Restart Your Computer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reboot your device to ensure the changes take effect. This is not strictly necessary when changing MTU size, however.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-this-fix-works&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Fix Works&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By reducing the MTU to 1280, you’re aligning the laptop’s outgoing packet size with the router and ISP’s negotiated limits (assuming the internet&amp;rsquo;s claim that Toob support have given a figure of 1280). This ensures that packets are not fragmented at the router, avoiding issues with outgoing traffic that could interfere with critical processes like HTTPS or TLS handshakes. While incoming data from web servers is generally unaffected by an MTU mismatch, setting the MTU consistently prevents outgoing fragmentation, which is crucial for web apps like Xero that rely on bidirectional communication. This fix resolved my client’s page loading and interaction issues entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why MFA Isn’t Enough: The Need for Stronger Security Measures in Microsoft 365</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/why-mfa-isnt-enough/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 03 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/why-mfa-isnt-enough/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-mfa-isnt-enough-the-need-for-stronger-security-measures-in-microsoft-365&#34;&gt;Why MFA Isn’t Enough: The Need for Stronger Security Measures in Microsoft 365&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is a robust solution for protecting online accounts, including those within Microsoft 365. It adds an extra layer of security beyond just a password, typically requiring a second factor like a text message code or an app-based approval. However, relying solely on MFA can lead to a false sense of security. While MFA is a significant improvement over password-only protection, it has vulnerabilities that can be exploited by determined attackers using a blend of social engineering and readily available (and easy-to-use) software.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-mfa-isnt-enough-the-need-for-stronger-security-measures-in-microsoft-365&#34;&gt;Why MFA Isn’t Enough: The Need for Stronger Security Measures in Microsoft 365&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is a robust solution for protecting online accounts, including those within Microsoft 365. It adds an extra layer of security beyond just a password, typically requiring a second factor like a text message code or an app-based approval. However, relying solely on MFA can lead to a false sense of security. While MFA is a significant improvement over password-only protection, it has vulnerabilities that can be exploited by determined attackers using a blend of social engineering and readily available (and easy-to-use) software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;evilginx&#34;&gt;Evilginx&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evilginx is a phishing framework that can steal credentials and session cookies even when MFA is in place. Evilginx acts as a man-in-the-middle, intercepting traffic between the user and the legitimate website. This allows attackers to capture not only the username and password but also the MFA token. An MFA token, or session cookie, is a file stored on a user&amp;rsquo;s device after successful authentication that prevents the need to re-enter MFA credentials repeatedly during the same session. Once in possession of a target&amp;rsquo;s login credentials and session cookie, the hacker can log in to the compromised account. Once inside, they can add their own MFA device to the hacked account, ensuring easy access in the future. Evilginx’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://help.evilginx.com/docs/getting-started/quick-start&#34;&gt;quick start guide&lt;/a&gt; promises to teach would-be hackers (ethical or otherwise) how to use the tool in just 5 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-role-of-social-engineering&#34;&gt;The Role of Social Engineering&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social engineering remains a powerful weapon in the attacker’s arsenal. Even the most secure systems can be compromised if a user is tricked into giving away their credentials or clicking on a malicious link. Phishing attacks, as they are known, have become increasingly sophisticated, often mimicking legitimate communications so well that even trained and/or cautious users can be fooled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;6-steps-to-hacking&#34;&gt;6 Steps to Hacking&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;1-setting-up-evilginx&#34;&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;Setting Up Evilginx:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The attacker sets up a server running Evilginx. This server will act as a reverse proxy, sitting between the victim and the legitimate website (e.g., Google, Microsoft, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The attacker configures Evilginx to impersonate the login page of the target website by cloning the legitimate website&amp;rsquo;s HTML, CSS, and JavaScript content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;2-creating-the-phishing-link&#34;&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;Creating the Phishing Link:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once Evilginx is set up, the attacker generates a phishing URL that points to the Evilginx server. This URL will look like it belongs to the legitimate website but will actually direct the victim to the attacker&amp;rsquo;s server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To make the URL less suspicious, attackers often use techniques like typosquatting (e.g., &amp;ldquo;g00gle.com&amp;rdquo; instead of &amp;ldquo;google.com&amp;rdquo;), URL shortening services, or even legitimate-looking domain names with subtle changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;3-sending-the-phishing-email&#34;&gt;3. &lt;strong&gt;Sending the Phishing Email:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The attacker crafts an email that looks legitimate, possibly impersonating a trusted entity (e.g., a colleague, IT department, or known service provider).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the email, they include a link to the &amp;lsquo;important document&amp;rsquo; or other urgent content, which is actually the phishing URL pointing to the Evilginx server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;4-victim-clicks-the-link&#34;&gt;4. &lt;strong&gt;Victim Clicks the Link:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the victim clicks on the link, they are directed to the Evilginx server. Evilginx, acting as a reverse proxy, forwards the victim&amp;rsquo;s traffic to the legitimate website in real time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The victim sees the actual login page of the legitimate website, making the phishing attempt harder to detect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;5-capturing-credentials-and-session-cookies&#34;&gt;5. &lt;strong&gt;Capturing Credentials and Session Cookies:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the victim enters their login credentials on the spoofed page, Evilginx captures these details before passing them on to the legitimate website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the victim uses two-factor authentication (2FA)/multi-factor authentication (MFA), Evilginx captures the MFA token as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The legitimate website then creates a session for the user (e.g., setting cookies), which is also captured by Evilginx. This allows the attacker to hijack the session and access the victim&amp;rsquo;s account without needing the login credentials again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;6-redirecting-the-victim&#34;&gt;6. &lt;strong&gt;Redirecting the Victim:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After capturing the credentials and session data, Evilginx usually redirects the victim to the legitimate website or a legitimate document, so the victim may not realise they&amp;rsquo;ve been phished.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-do-hackers-do-it&#34;&gt;Why Do Hackers Do It?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the earlier days of hacking and computer viruses, the motivations of hackers and virus creators were often different from those seen today. Early hackers were driven by a mix of curiosity, challenge, experimentation, and, in some cases, a desire for recognition or notoriety. Modern cybercriminals frequently seek financial gain through ransomware, data theft, and other malicious activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a hacker gains access to a victim&amp;rsquo;s account, their primary focus is often on the victim&amp;rsquo;s email. Typically, the hacker will create inbox rules to filter or hide specific incoming emails from the legitimate user, ensuring that their activities go unnoticed. They may also delete sent emails to cover their tracks. The hacker’s goal is to remain undetected for as long as possible, potentially engaging in a &amp;ldquo;long game&amp;rdquo; by interacting with third parties known to the victim. Their ultimate aim might be to extort money by redirecting payments for an outstanding invoice to a bank account they control. This type of stealthy and insidious behaviour can result in significant financial loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, some hackers are less cautious and use the compromised account to send thousands of spam or phishing emails. This more blatant misuse often leads to a quicker discovery, as third parties frequently report the suspicious activity back to the victim, often through non-email channels, alerting them to the breach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;user-training-important-but-not-sufficient&#34;&gt;User Training: Important but Not Sufficient&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many organisations emphasise user training as the first line of defence against these kinds of attacks; it’s not possible to use Evilginx to simply hack an account—the hacker must trick the target into visiting the fake website and entering their credentials. While educating users on recognising phishing attempts and maintaining good security hygiene is crucial, it’s arguably not enough. Humans are fallible, and even well-trained individuals can make mistakes. Social engineering attacks are designed to exploit this very weakness. Therefore, relying solely on user training as a defence mechanism is risky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-case-for-hard-controls-conditional-access-and-device-compliance&#34;&gt;The Case for Hard Controls: Conditional Access and Device Compliance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the limitations of MFA and the susceptibility of users to social engineering, it’s clear that stronger, more technical controls are necessary. One of the most effective strategies is implementing Conditional Access policies that restrict access to Microsoft 365 resources based on device compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does this mean?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It means that only devices that meet certain security criteria—such as being enrolled in Intune, Microsoft’s device management platform—are allowed to access corporate resources. Enrolling devices into Intune ensures that they are compliant with your organisation’s security policies, such as having up-to-date antivirus software, operating systems, encryption, and other protections. This approach significantly reduces the risk of unauthorised access, as attackers would need to compromise a compliant device (i.e., gain remote control or have physical access to it) to gain entry, which is far more challenging than bypassing MFA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corporate-Owned vs. Personal Devices&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it’s ideal for all devices accessing corporate resources to be company-owned and tightly controlled, the reality is that many employees prefer to use their personal mobile devices for work, especially for checking email. To accommodate this, organisations can offer users the option to enrol their personal devices in Intune. This allows IT to enforce security policies on personal devices without compromising the user’s privacy for non-work-related activities. However, users should be aware that enrolling their personal devices means the organisation can enforce security requirements, such as mandatory updates and the ability to remotely wipe the device if it’s lost or stolen. The remote wipe of personally owned, enrolled devices is normally selective, i.e., only corporate data is removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion-the-need-for-a-multi-layered-approach&#34;&gt;Conclusion: The Need for a Multi-Layered Approach&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While MFA is a crucial component of a secure Microsoft 365 environment, it should not be relied on in isolation. The combination of easily accessible hacking tools like Evilginx, the prevalence of social engineering attacks, and the fallibility of human users means that organisations must implement stronger controls. Conditional Access policies that ensure only compliant devices can access corporate resources offer a more reliable defence against unauthorised access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By enrolling devices into Intune, organisations can ensure that security policies are consistently enforced, reducing the risk of a breach. In today’s threat landscape, a multi-layered approach that includes hard technical controls is essential to safeguarding your Microsoft 365 environment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Windows 10 Remote Desktop Connection Fix: The system administrator has restricted the types of logon (network or interactive) that you may use</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A client of mine was attempting to access a Windows 10 Enterprise workstation from a laptop using RDP but encountered this error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The system administrator has restricted the types of logon (network or interactive) that you may use. For assistance, contact your system administrator or technical support&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

For assistance, contact your system administrator or technical support&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I checked the usual:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remote access is enabled&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The user account used for remote access is local is a member of the local administrators group&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He had turned off NLA and the firewall (for troubleshooting purposes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All settings were correct. I eventually started digging around the local security policy (run secpol.msc or search for &amp;rsquo;local security policy&amp;rsquo; in the windows menu) with the aim of checking that the &amp;lsquo;Allow log on through Remote Desktop Services&amp;rsquo; had the administrators group listed. It did. While there, however, I noticed that under &amp;lsquo;&lt;strong&gt;Deny&lt;/strong&gt; log on through Remote Desktop Services&amp;rsquo; there was an entry for &amp;rsquo;local account&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find/ open local security policy app&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/20240523/search-for-local-security-policy.png&#34; alt=&#34;Find/ open local security policy app.&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find Deny log on through Remote Desktop Services&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/20240523/local-sec-policy.png&#34; alt=&#34;Find Deny log on through Remote Desktop Services.&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remove &amp;ldquo;Local account&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/20240523/local-sec-policy-2.png&#34; alt=&#34;Remove “Local account”.&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was it, problem solved! This security policy appears to be a default for the Enterprise edition of Windows, most likely because Microsoft expect the computer to be domain joined (this particular workstation was standalone). Note also that &amp;ldquo;Deny access to this computer from the network&amp;rdquo; also contained the Local account object.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Email delivery failure from Microsoft 365 to Yahoo</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had a customer report today that all emails they were sending from their Microsoft 365 account to all Yahoo email addresses were eventually bouncing as non deliverable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A message trace reveals this rather unhelpful information:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that Yahoo seem to &lt;em&gt;require&lt;/em&gt; all sending domains to use DKIM and to have a valid DMARC record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;setting-up-dkim-on-microsoft-365&#34;&gt;Setting up DKIM on Microsoft 365&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/email-authentication-dkim-configure?view=o365-worldwide&#34;&gt;How to use DKIM for email in your custom domain | Microsoft Learn&lt;/a&gt; to For instructions on setting up DKIM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;create-a-dmarc-record&#34;&gt;Create a DMARC record&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several tools online to help you generate a DMARC record which is then published using DNS:
&lt;a href=&#34;https://dmarcian.com/dmarc-record-wizard/&#34;&gt;DMARC record generator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;3rd-party-domain-spoofing&#34;&gt;3rd party domain spoofing&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you also use 3rd party services, like Mailchimp for example, that will send emails from your domain then ensure they a) support DKIM signing and b) follow their instructions on setting this up; more DNS records will be required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;double-check-your-spf-record&#34;&gt;Double check your SPF record&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linked with the above point regarding 3rd party &amp;lsquo;spoofers&amp;rsquo;, make sure your SPF record includes all entries for all 3rd parties sending mail on your behalf. This is especially important if you&amp;rsquo;ve created a strict DMARC policy that requires SPF and DMARC alignment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the brief post. If none of this means anything and you&amp;rsquo;re having mail delivery issues. Then reach out to me!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Handling null properties in JSON payloads in Power Automate</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/handling-null-properties-in-json-payloads-in-power-automate/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 08 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/handling-null-properties-in-json-payloads-in-power-automate/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Following on from my previous article on querying the Companies House API in Microsoft Power Automate, in this article I&amp;rsquo;ll explore an option for handling missing JSON properties in a given payload that are necessary for subsequent actions in your flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-problem&#34;&gt;The Problem&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an overview, this is what my flow does:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a source Excel spreadsheet, iterate through a list of company registration numbers that I&amp;rsquo;m interested in finding charge information for.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;Following on from my previous article on querying the Companies House API in Microsoft Power Automate, in this article I&amp;rsquo;ll explore an option for handling missing JSON properties in a given payload that are necessary for subsequent actions in your flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-problem&#34;&gt;The Problem&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an overview, this is what my flow does:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a source Excel spreadsheet, iterate through a list of company registration numbers that I&amp;rsquo;m interested in finding charge information for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this loop, there is an HTTP GET action that constructs a URI from the current row of the Excel spreadsheet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following this is a Parse JSON action, the contents of which are used to set up another (nested) loop which iterates through all &amp;lsquo;charges&amp;rsquo; listed against that company&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is then a 3rd nested loop (a loop within a loop within a loop) that iterates through &amp;lsquo;persons entitled&amp;rsquo;, which is an array associated with each charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data is written to a SQL database using an Insert Row action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, during the course of testing my flow, I noticed that some of the JSON payloads were causing the flow to fail. Why? Because some charges (very old ones) registered on Companies House have no persons entitled listed. This means the JSON property &amp;lsquo;persons_entitled&amp;rsquo; was completely missing. Without this, the 3rd loop, which required this property to exist, would fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Power Automate doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a failsafe mechanism for dealing with null entities, so we have to be a little creative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-solution&#34;&gt;The Solution&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution I used was to create a condition action:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/20240308/condition.png&#34; alt=&#34;The condition action in Power Automate&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here you can see my flow. The condition action sits directly below the loop which iterates through the list of charges in the Companies House JSON payload. Its job is to check the existence of the &amp;lsquo;persons_entitled&amp;rsquo; property. If it exists, then continue with the inner most loop (IteratePersonsEntitled), if not, then effectively do nothing (I have a compose action here that simply concatinates a string; it&amp;rsquo;s merely there so &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; happens in the false branch).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The condition contains the following expression:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34; data-lang=&#34;javascript&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;contains&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;IterateCharges&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;), &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;persons_entitled&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The contains function inspects items from the IterateCharges loop, looking for the existence of the persons_entitled array. If this property was missing entirely from the JSON payload (for a given charge) then that array will be absent and the function will return false.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/20240308/function.png&#34; alt=&#34;Condition expression configuration&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you can see the logic. If the persons_entitled array is present, the contains function returns true. The condition expression states that if the expression = true then proceed with the actions in the true branch, else follow the false branch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now my flow can continue without falling over in the event of a missing property!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;other-tweaks&#34;&gt;Other Tweaks&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to amend the JSON schema I posted in my &lt;a href=&#34;https://echo3.co/posts/using-power-automate-with-the-companies-house-api/&#34;&gt;previous article&lt;/a&gt;, removing several required properties, notably &amp;rsquo;links&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;persons_entitled&amp;rsquo; since this was also causing my flow to fail when these were not included in the JSON payload.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some companies queried via the API do not have any charges listed, so the API returns a 404 not found error. To handle this in Power Automate, you must configure the &amp;lsquo;run after&amp;rsquo; setting for the action directly following the HTTP action:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/20240308/runafter.png&#34; alt=&#34;Configuring run after in Power Automate&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my flow, I have a delay action that I added to avoid the 600 queries per 5 minutes imposed by the Companies House API. Here I ticked the &amp;lsquo;Has failed&amp;rsquo; option under Run After under the HTTP action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;☕️ If you found this post helpful, I&amp;rsquo;d appreciate it if you would &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.buymeacoffee.com/heyjudeuk&#34;&gt;buy me a coffee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>NOW / Sky broadband and Microsoft 365 connectivity errors</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/now-broadband-and-microsoft-365-errors/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/now-broadband-and-microsoft-365-errors/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve had three people from different households have weird errors while working from home. All involved connecting to OneDrive or attempting to save an Office document back to Sharepoint or OneDrive. The error thrown by (Excel in this example) is rather enigmatic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The server you are trying to access is using an authentication protocol not supported by this version of Office.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/20240221/error_message.webp&#34; alt=&#34;The server you are trying to access is using an authentication protocol not supported by this version of Office.&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve had three people from different households have weird errors while working from home. All involved connecting to OneDrive or attempting to save an Office document back to Sharepoint or OneDrive. The error thrown by (Excel in this example) is rather enigmatic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The server you are trying to access is using an authentication protocol not supported by this version of Office.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/20240221/error_message.webp&#34; alt=&#34;The server you are trying to access is using an authentication protocol not supported by this version of Office.&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when asked to sign out and back in to the Windows OneDrive app, this happened:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/20240221/one_drive_error.png&#34; alt=&#34;OneDrive signing in hangs.&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One Drive refused to sign back in, just hanging forever with the words &amp;lsquo;signing in&amp;rsquo; with a spinning circle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three reported no issues when back at the office. What did each of these people have in common? They are all using NOW broadband (Sky). As part of my troubleshooting, I ran IPconfig to check IP details, in particular to see what DNS servers they were using. However, the local IP returned for each was an &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6&#34;&gt;IPv6 address&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s nice to see Sky advancing internet technology, however Microsoft doesn&amp;rsquo;t appear to like it. I disabled IPv6 on each computer and all the errors disappeared immediately and service was restored. Not even a reboot was required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to log into any of my clients&amp;rsquo; routers to see whether it was possible to disable IPv6 at the source, I had to disable it via the Windows control panel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Press the Windows button on the left side of the keyboard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type: &lt;strong&gt;ncpa.cpl&lt;/strong&gt; and press return&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right click the network adapter you are using (this is wired, but you may be using a wireless adapater):&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/20240221/step01.png&#34; alt=&#34;Ethernet adapter in Windows&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click &lt;strong&gt;properties&lt;/strong&gt; and untick Internet Protocol Version 6:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/20240221/step02.png&#34; alt=&#34;Windows IPv6&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click &lt;strong&gt;OK&lt;/strong&gt; and you&amp;rsquo;re done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just remember you&amp;rsquo;ve done this because at some point in the future, the future is IPv6 😉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why this picture? Like all the pixel art on my website, this one is generated by OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s DALL·E 2. The prompt for this was &amp;ldquo;A row of Victorian clerks with a robot stealing a ledger in a sneaky way&amp;rdquo;. How does this relate to this article? Companies House evokes (in my mind at least) a huge library of records meticulously maintained by hardworking scribes beavering away with quill and ink while the robot symbolises our modern web tech filching their data. Yeah, my mind is a peculiar place!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Why this picture? Like all the pixel art on my website, this one is generated by OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s DALL·E 2. The prompt for this was &amp;ldquo;A row of Victorian clerks with a robot stealing a ledger in a sneaky way&amp;rdquo;. How does this relate to this article? Companies House evokes (in my mind at least) a huge library of records meticulously maintained by hardworking scribes beavering away with quill and ink while the robot symbolises our modern web tech filching their data. Yeah, my mind is a peculiar place!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A client asked whether I could investigate pulling data from Companies House using their API. This is still work in progress since ultimately the data harvested will be dumped into a database for later reporting using PowerBI. However, I thought it might be useful to document the process of using Microsoft Power Automate (my chosen tool for this task) to perform HTML GET operations via the Companies House API and parsing the subsequent JSON payload.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;step-1-create-an-application--api-key&#34;&gt;Step 1: Create an application &amp;amp; API key&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visit: &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.company-information.service.gov.uk/manage-applications/add&#34;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt; to create an application in your Companies House &amp;lsquo;Developer Hub&amp;rsquo;. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have an account, you will need to register first (it&amp;rsquo;s free). You can&amp;rsquo;t use your webfiling account (if you have one).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fill in the new application form. It&amp;rsquo;s fine to choose &amp;lsquo;Live&amp;rsquo; under &amp;lsquo;Choose an environment for your application&amp;rsquo;. Click the application name you&amp;rsquo;ve just created. In my example, it&amp;rsquo;s called GCF:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/20240209/step01.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Create an application in Companies House&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can&amp;rsquo;t find this page, here&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.company-information.service.gov.uk/manage-applications&#34;&gt;a handy link&lt;/a&gt;. On the next page, there should be a green &lt;strong&gt;Create new key&lt;/strong&gt; button under the heading &lt;strong&gt;&amp;lsquo;Keys for this application&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give the key a name, a description and select &lt;strong&gt;REST&lt;/strong&gt; as the API type and leave the remaining fields blank:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/20240209/step01b.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Create an API key in Companies House&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then click the green &lt;strong&gt;Create Key&lt;/strong&gt; button. On the next page, copy the API key. There is a &amp;lsquo;Copy&amp;rsquo; link, but this didn&amp;rsquo;t work for me at the time of writing, so I had to highlight and copy the key manually:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/20240209/step01c.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Copy API key&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must now convert this key into base64 which will be used to authorise the GET request in Power Automate later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Head over to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.base64encode.org/&#34;&gt;base64encode.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And paste your API key &lt;strong&gt;plus a colon&lt;/strong&gt; (:). This is important because the API uses Basic Authentication without a password. The trailing colon is important because it adheres to the Basic Authentication standard, ensuring that the server can correctly parse the base64 encoded string and identify the username (or API key in this case) without expecting a password. Without the colon, the server might interpret the entire base64 encoded string as the username, leading to authentication errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click the &lt;strong&gt;ENCODE&lt;/strong&gt; button and you should end up with something that looks like this: OTExNWVjNTQtYTA5NC00MDQ2LTlmYmMtMDcwNDg4YjhkOWZmOg==
Don&amp;rsquo;t try and use this key as it will be deleted by the time you read this article!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;step-2-create-a-new-flow-in-power-automate&#34;&gt;Step 2: Create a new flow in Power Automate&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that to use HTTP GET (required for this task), you will need a premium license. In my example, I&amp;rsquo;m going to use a simple manually triggered flow to see who holds charges for a given company on Companies House. In the future I will develop this flow to iterate through a spreadsheet of companies that my client is interested in, dumping out the retrieved data into an Azure SQL database for later reporting. But for now, we&amp;rsquo;ll keep it simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From your &lt;a href=&#34;https://make.powerautomate.com/&#34;&gt;Power Automate homepage&lt;/a&gt; create a flow, using a manual trigger. Start from a blank &amp;lsquo;Instant cloud flow&amp;rsquo;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/20240209/step02.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Create a flow&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Name your flow and select &amp;lsquo;Manually trigger a flow&amp;rsquo;, then click &lt;strong&gt;Create&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/20240209/step02b.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Create a flow step 2&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;step-3-create-an-html-get-action&#34;&gt;Step 3: Create an HTML GET action&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, click on the &amp;lsquo;Manually trigger a flow&amp;rsquo; action and in the flyout on the left, click &amp;lsquo;add an input&amp;rsquo;. Select &lt;strong&gt;Number&lt;/strong&gt;, and type RegNo in the Number field, leaving &amp;lsquo;Please enter a number&amp;rsquo; as the default. We will use this company registration number to query Companies House via their API to get the data we want:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/20240209/step03.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Configure the manual trigger&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, add an action in your flow by clicking the + button under the manual trigger. In the flyout, search for HTTP and select the HTTP action:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/20240209/step03b.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Add the HTTP action&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are going to use the &amp;lsquo;charges&amp;rsquo; &amp;rsquo;list&amp;rsquo; API request to return a list of charges for a company:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://developer-specs.company-information.service.gov.uk/companies-house-public-data-api/reference/charges/list?v=latest&#34;&gt;https://developer-specs.company-information.service.gov.uk/companies-house-public-data-api/reference/charges/list&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click the newly added HTTP action in the Flow designer and paste this URL into the URI field:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-html&#34; data-lang=&#34;html&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;https://api.company-information.service.gov.uk/company//charges
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need to supply the company registration number in our request, so click the space inbetween the forward slashes after company and before charges and select &lt;strong&gt;insert dynamic content&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/20240209/step03c.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Configure the GET request&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the pop up menu, click &lt;strong&gt;See More&lt;/strong&gt; next &amp;lsquo;Manually trigger a flow&amp;rsquo;, then select &lt;strong&gt;RegNo&lt;/strong&gt; in the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/20240209/step03d.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Insert a dynamic field&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Select &lt;strong&gt;GET&lt;/strong&gt; in the Method dropdown and type &lt;strong&gt;Authorization&lt;/strong&gt; in the first Headers box where it says &amp;lsquo;Enter Key&amp;rsquo;. In the box next to it, type &lt;strong&gt;Basic&lt;/strong&gt; then a space and then paste your base64 API key where is says &amp;lsquo;Enter Value&amp;rsquo;. You should end up with something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/20240209/step03e.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Fully configured HTTP GET request&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;step-4-parse-json&#34;&gt;Step 4: Parse JSON&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add another step directly below your HTTP action, search for and add the &lt;strong&gt;Parse JSON&lt;/strong&gt; action. In the configuration box on the left, click into &amp;lsquo;Content&amp;rsquo; and click the lightning bolt icon to open the dynamic picker menu. Under HTTP select &lt;strong&gt;Body&lt;/strong&gt;. The JSON schema we need to provide is a little tricky since Companies House don&amp;rsquo;t provide a JSON schema and the JSON chargeList resource they give cannot be used to generate one (you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; generate a schema from it, but your flow will fail!). In the end I had to run my flow with just the manual trigger and HTTP action, examine the raw output from the HTTP action (the JSON payload sent by Companies House) and use that to generate the JSON schema. Once I had the JSON output, I added the Parse JSON action back and then clicked the &amp;lsquo;Use sample payload to generate schema&amp;rsquo; in the Parse JSON action properties and it gave me this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34; data-lang=&#34;javascript&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;{
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;type&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;object&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;properties&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;        &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;etag&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;            &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;type&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;string&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;        },
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;        &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;total_count&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;            &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;type&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;integer&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;        },
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;        &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;unfiltered_count&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;            &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;type&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;integer&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;        },
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;        &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;satisfied_count&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;            &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;type&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;integer&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;        },

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;                ]
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;            }
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;        }
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    }
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your configured Parse JSON action should look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/20240209/step04.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Fully configured Parse JSON&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;step-5-setting-up-the-loops&#34;&gt;Step 5: Setting up the loops&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JSON we are parsing has several nested arrays. We want to iterate through the list of charges for the company specified and then iterate through each charge to get the &amp;lsquo;persons entitled&amp;rsquo;. We are therefore going to have to set up two loops, one nested within the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the Parse JSON action, click the plus button and add an &lt;strong&gt;Apply to each&lt;/strong&gt; action. The usual configuration box pops up from the left. First, rename the action (click on Apply to each) to &lt;strong&gt;Outer&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now click in &amp;lsquo;Select An Output From Previous Steps&amp;rsquo; and click the &lt;em&gt;fx&lt;/em&gt; icon to the right. In the function box type:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34; data-lang=&#34;javascript&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;outputs&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;Parse_JSON&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;[&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;body&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;]&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;[&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;items&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;]
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then click &lt;strong&gt;Add&lt;/strong&gt;. Your final config should look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/20240209/step05b.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Configuring the outer loop&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, click the plus button inside the grey box under the &amp;lsquo;Outer&amp;rsquo; action&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/20240209/step05c.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Adding the inner loop&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add another &lt;strong&gt;Apply to each&lt;/strong&gt; action and name this one &lt;strong&gt;Inner&lt;/strong&gt;. Click in &amp;lsquo;Select An Output From Previous Steps&amp;rsquo; and click the &lt;em&gt;fx&lt;/em&gt; icon to the right. In the function box type:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34; data-lang=&#34;javascript&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;Outer&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;[&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;persons_entitled&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;]
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;step-6-create-an-add-row-to-an-excel-table-action&#34;&gt;Step 6: Create an add row to an Excel table action&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create an Excel spreadsheet in OneDrive and create a table within this spreadsheet with the following headers: Reg_no, charge_ID and Persons_entitled_name. Now in your flow, click the plus button directly below the Inner loop, search for and add the &lt;strong&gt;Add a row into a table&lt;/strong&gt; (Excel) action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the configuration box, select your spreadsheet (you may be prompted to authenticate to OneDrive) and select your table within your spreadsheet. Under &amp;lsquo;Advanced parameters&amp;rsquo;, use the checkboxes to show the three headers above (Reg_no, charge_ID and Persons_entitled_name).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &amp;lsquo;Reg_no&amp;rsquo;, click the lightning icon, scroll down through the picker and select &lt;strong&gt;RegNo&lt;/strong&gt; under &amp;lsquo;Manually trigger a flow&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/20240209/step06.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Configuring the add row action step 1&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &amp;lsquo;Charge_ID&amp;rsquo; click the &lt;em&gt;fx&lt;/em&gt; button and enter the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34; data-lang=&#34;javascript&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;Outer&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;[&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;charge_code&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;]
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &amp;lsquo;Persons_entitled_name&amp;rsquo; click the &lt;em&gt;fx&lt;/em&gt; button and enter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34; data-lang=&#34;javascript&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;Inner&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;[&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;name&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;]
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final config should look like this for the &amp;lsquo;Add a row into a table&amp;rsquo; action:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/20240209/step06b.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Configuring the add row action final config&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the final flow should look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/20240209/finalflow.webp&#34; alt=&#34;What the final flow looks like&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;step-7-save-and-run-your-flow&#34;&gt;Step 7: Save and run your flow!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click the Save button. Your flow will be validated and saved. Now click Test. Select &amp;lsquo;Manually&amp;rsquo;, enter a valid company registration number and then click the blue &lt;strong&gt;Run flow&lt;/strong&gt; button. If there are any charges for that company, the charge code will be written to the Excel table along with the &amp;rsquo;entitled persons&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;further-considerations&#34;&gt;Further considerations&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future development of this flow will involve iterating through a list of companies my client is interested in, rather than having to manually enter a company registration number each time. Some error handling will need to be added to account for 404 &amp;rsquo;not found&amp;rsquo; returns by the API and some consideration will be needed for the default API limit of 600 requests within a five minute period.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to fix the buffer time problem in Microsoft Bookings</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/fixing-the-buffer-time-problem-in-microsoft-bookings/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I write this post I have just started using Microsoft Bookings. As an IT professional, having the ability for a client to visit my Bookings page and put an appointment in my diary is a great way of avoiding the usual back and forth via email to pin down a mutually convenient time. Out of the box, Bookings offers a good deal of flexibility, including the option of adding &lt;strong&gt;&amp;lsquo;buffer time&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt; to allow for preparation, travel between appointments, avoiding back to back appointments etc. However, as noted by many here &lt;a href=&#34;https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-bookings-ideas/calendar-time-vs-buffer-time/idi-p/2469887&#34;&gt;Calendar time vs Buffer time - Microsoft Community Hub&lt;/a&gt;
, this feature is flawed: The first appointment that was created by the system resulted in me ringing my client 30 minutes early, because the buffer time set simply &lt;em&gt;extends&lt;/em&gt; the event in the calendar; the reminder pops up and then I must remember to ring my client 30 minutes later. The &amp;rsquo;time with client&amp;rsquo; is buried in the event notes. Not great &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Out of the box, Bookings offers a good deal of flexibility, including the option of adding &lt;strong&gt;&amp;lsquo;buffer time&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt; to allow for preparation, travel between appointments, avoiding back to back appointments etc. However, as noted by many here &lt;a href=&#34;https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-bookings-ideas/calendar-time-vs-buffer-time/idi-p/2469887&#34;&gt;Calendar time vs Buffer time - Microsoft Community Hub&lt;/a&gt;
, this feature is flawed: The first appointment that was created by the system resulted in me ringing my client 30 minutes early, because the buffer time set simply &lt;em&gt;extends&lt;/em&gt; the event in the calendar; the reminder pops up and then I must remember to ring my client 30 minutes later. The &amp;rsquo;time with client&amp;rsquo; is buried in the event notes. Not great &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;-a-workaround-using-microsoft-power-automate&#34;&gt;➡️🔄 A workaround using Microsoft Power Automate&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By leveraging Power Automate, we can create a flow that automatically adds a &amp;lsquo;buffer time&amp;rsquo; event around the booking, ensuring that reminders and scheduling reflect the actual appointment times, not the buffer periods. Here&amp;rsquo;s how:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;step-1-add-the-power-automate-integration-to-microsoft-bookings&#34;&gt;Step 1: Add the Power Automate integration to Microsoft Bookings&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turn off your buffer time for all services in Microsoft Bookings and click the Integrations button in the sidebar:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/20240131/step_01.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Selecting the ‘Create a flow’ option in Power Automate to begin fixing the buffer time issue in Microsoft Bookings&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of writing, this is the only integration offered:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/20240131/step_02.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Select Power Automate as a connector for Microsoft Bookings&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then click &amp;lsquo;Go to Setup&amp;rsquo;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/20240131/step_03.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Select Go to setup&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;step-2-create-the-trigger&#34;&gt;Step 2: Create the trigger&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want our flow to trigger when a new appointment is created:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/20240131/step_04.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Create a Flow trigger when an appointment is created in Microsoft Bookings&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should then be presented with Power Automate&amp;rsquo;s design grid with a sole trigger event &amp;lsquo;When a appointment is Created&amp;rsquo; (spot the grammatical errors!). There will be an alarming &lt;em&gt;&amp;lsquo;Invalid parameters&amp;rsquo;&lt;/em&gt; warning. Just click it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/20240131/step_05.webp&#34; alt=&#34;The trigger shows an invalid parameters warning&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the dropdown, select the appropriate booking page. When an appointment is made using this Bookings page, it will trigger your flow automation. I only have one setup in this example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/20240131/step_06.webp&#34; alt=&#34;In the trigger properties, select the appropriate bookings page&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;step-3-calculate-buffer-times&#34;&gt;Step 3: Calculate buffer times&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this step we are going to create two calculated variables that will define the start and end time of our buffer appointment. In my example, I am using a pre and post meeting buffer time of 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, click the plus button directly below your trigger in the flow grid:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/20240131/step_07.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Add the first variable after the event trigger&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the left hand flyout, search for &lt;strong&gt;&amp;lsquo;initialize variable&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt; and click it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/20240131/step_08.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Find and select initialize variable&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the parameters tab, enter &lt;strong&gt;PreMeetingBuffer&lt;/strong&gt; under Name, use the dropdown to select &lt;strong&gt;String&lt;/strong&gt; under Type and next to Value, click the fx button:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/20240131/step_09.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Fill in the variable parameters&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And copy and paste the following code. We are using the addMinutes function to subtract 30 minutes from the start time of the appointment that triggered the flow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34; data-lang=&#34;javascript&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;addMinutes&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;triggerOutputs&lt;/span&gt;()&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;[&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;body/StartTime&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;], &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now click &lt;strong&gt;Add&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/20240131/step_10.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Commit the variable by clicking Add&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You now need to add another variable, following the steps above, this time clicking the plus sign under the newly appeared &lt;strong&gt;&amp;lsquo;Initialize variable&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt; action. Call this new variable &lt;strong&gt;PostMeetingBuffer&lt;/strong&gt; and use the following function to calculate the end of our buffer appointment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34; data-lang=&#34;javascript&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;addMinutes&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;triggerOutputs&lt;/span&gt;()&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;[&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;body/EndTime&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;], &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my example, the buffer appointment will be 30 minutes longer than the triggering event booking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should now have three objects in your Flow: A trigger and &lt;strong&gt;two variables&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;step-4-create-a-buffer-calendar-event&#34;&gt;Step 4: Create a buffer calendar event&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click the plus sign below the last action you created (the second variable, which should be called &lt;strong&gt;Initialize variable 1&lt;/strong&gt; by default). In the flyout on the left, search for &lt;strong&gt;create event&lt;/strong&gt; and add it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/20240131/step_11.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Add the create event action in Microsoft Power Automate&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the parameters tab, select your calendar from the dropdown (normally just called &lt;strong&gt;Calendar&lt;/strong&gt;) and give it a name under Subject (I&amp;rsquo;m calling mine &lt;strong&gt;Booking Buffer&lt;/strong&gt;). Click the lightning bolt symbol next to the Start Time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/20240131/step_12.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Click the lightning bolt symbol next to Start Time&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And select the &lt;strong&gt;PreMeetingBuffer&lt;/strong&gt; variable we created earlier:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/20240131/step_13.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Select the PreMeetingBuffer variable&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the End time, select the &lt;strong&gt;PostMeetingBuffer&lt;/strong&gt; variable. Under advanced parameters I&amp;rsquo;ve also done the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turned reminders OFF&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show as Busy (by default any event created using this action would show as available)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/20240131/step_14.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Configure the create event action&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, your flow should look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/20240131/flow_overview.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Final flow overview&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Save your flow and then test it by creating a booking via your Bookings page. You should end up with something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/20240131/final_step.webp&#34; alt=&#34;A calendar with a buffer appointment around it&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The buffer appointment won&amp;rsquo;t trigger a reminder (if you configured the advanced parameters above) but it will prevent back to back bookings (make sure you configure the &amp;lsquo;busy&amp;rsquo; parameter above) and you will only receive calendar notifications for the actual events generated by your Bookings page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t looked at creating flows for deleting or amending these automatically generated buffer events if the original booking is cancelled or amended. Something for another day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NB: I did try the Copilot AI to help create the flow, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t helpful, so I ended up having to use my brain! 🧠&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;2-cloud-infrastructure&#34;&gt;2. Cloud Infrastructure&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transform your business with scalable and flexible cloud solutions. For example, I can move legacy on-premise servers and software solutions into Microsoft Azure, a move that ensures your business operations are not just modernized, but also secured under the umbrella of Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s vast and robust infrastructure. This shift not only brings your systems up to date with the latest cloud technology but also provides the reassurance that your workloads are safeguarded with industry-leading security and reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;3-fortified-security&#34;&gt;3. Fortified Security&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep Your Online World Safe and Sound: In the digital age, it&amp;rsquo;s crucial to ensure that the websites and online content your business interacts with are safe and appropriate. I offer smart solutions that act like vigilant guardians for your internet use, filtering out harmful or unwanted content before it reaches you. This means safer browsing for you and your team, reducing the risk of stumbling upon anything that could harm your computers or compromise your data. Imagine it as having a highly skilled, always-alert digital bouncer, keeping the bad stuff out and letting only the good stuff in. Let&amp;rsquo;s make your online experience safer and more secure together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;4-backup--continuity-keeping-your-data-safe-and-sound&#34;&gt;4. Backup &amp;amp; Continuity: Keeping Your Data Safe and Sound&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of your business data like precious memories in a photo album. You wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want to lose them. That&amp;rsquo;s where third-party cloud backup comes in. It&amp;rsquo;s like having a digital safety net. Even if something goes wrong with your main data storage (like those services you use every day for emails or documents), your information is duplicated and kept safe in another secure place. This means if the unexpected happens—like accidental deletions or system glitches—you can quickly get back on track without losing a beat. Keep your business data protected and accessible, no matter what the day brings. This is especially important for Sharepoint libraries; it&amp;rsquo;s easy to delete an entire folder of data, but very time consuming to recover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Choose This Hub?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Convenience:&lt;/strong&gt; One bill for a comprehensive range of services, reducing administrative overhead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Customization:&lt;/strong&gt; Tailored solutions to fit your specific business needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expert Support:&lt;/strong&gt; As your trusted advisor, I&amp;rsquo;m here to guide you through choosing and using these services effectively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By partnering with me, you gain access to a suite of services that are pivotal for modern businesses, all streamlined under one roof. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s enhancing productivity, fortifying security, or ensuring seamless operations, the Cloud Services Hub is your gateway to a more efficient and secure digital business environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FAQ:&lt;/strong&gt; What Happens If You&amp;rsquo;re Run Over by a Bus? How will our cloud services be affected?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;rsquo;s important to plan for every eventuality, even the unexpected ones! To ensure continuity and peace of mind, I have a failsafe in place for such scenarios. All my clients have their own admin account for all the cloud services I resell. This means that if anything were to happen to me, you would still have full access to your cloud services. You can continue using these services seamlessly and can choose any other reseller or service provider to continue your subscriptions. This approach ensures that your business operations remain uninterrupted, no matter what happens. Your autonomy and access to your critical services are my top priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ready to simplify your cloud journey? Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about how these services can propel your business forward!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personalized Tech Coaching:&lt;/strong&gt; My forte is in guiding those who find technology challenging, helping them become adept and self-assured in its use. The digital world is vast, filled with various software packages, mobile and desktop apps, and web-based SaaS platforms.

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;-hands-on-services-practical-tech-installations&#34;&gt;🛠️ Hands-On Services: Practical Tech Installations&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alongside my digital expertise, I also bring a practical touch to physical tech installations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meeting Room Setup:&lt;/strong&gt; For conferencing, my preference is for Logitech equipment. It strikes a good balance between price and performance and is compatible with all mainstream platforms such as Meet, Teams and Zoom. I can wall mount TVs, cameras and neatly cable all necessary equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security Installations:&lt;/strong&gt; My services extend to setting up small-scale security solutions. This includes the installation of smart doorbells and network video cameras.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since diving into the IT world in 1999 and embracing the freelance journey in 2011, &lt;strong&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve carved out a niche as a versatile &amp;ldquo;general practitioner&amp;rdquo; in technology.&lt;/strong&gt; My love for variety means I thrive on the diverse challenges and projects that come my way, from streamlining complex processes to teaching tech skills. There&amp;rsquo;s no typical day in my life, and that&amp;rsquo;s just how I like it!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Since diving into the IT world in 1999 and embracing the freelance journey in 2011, &lt;strong&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve carved out a niche as a versatile &amp;ldquo;general practitioner&amp;rdquo; in technology.&lt;/strong&gt; My love for variety means I thrive on the diverse challenges and projects that come my way, from streamlining complex processes to teaching tech skills. There&amp;rsquo;s no typical day in my life, and that&amp;rsquo;s just how I like it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;turning-complexity-into-simplicity&#34;&gt;Turning Complexity into Simplicity&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my greatest joys is transforming what seems complex into something beautifully simple. Like the time recently where I replaced an entire manual process with a Google Sheet, a dash of code and Data Studio – not only saving a client from hiring an extra hand but also enhancing their website with an interactive dashboard. &lt;strong&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s about seeing beyond the conventional, finding clarity where others see complexity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;a-unique-perspective&#34;&gt;A Unique Perspective&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve never been one to simply follow the crowd. Take this website, for example. Countless IT support company websites are filled with technobabble, stock photography, and generic images of people in suits or in offices, either laughing or staring intently at laptop screens. I wanted my website to stand out from that mold. There&amp;rsquo;s a nostalgic part of me that fondly recalls my early interactions with technology — think ZX Spectrums, BBC model Bs, and Atari STs. That&amp;rsquo;s why I chose a retro theme and pixel art for my site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This distinct way of thinking isn&amp;rsquo;t just about aesthetics; it reflects how I approach business. By thinking outside the box, I generate unique ideas and solutions tailored to the specific needs of each client.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;just-in-time-knowledge&#34;&gt;Just-in-Time Knowledge&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I firmly believe in &amp;ldquo;just-in-time&amp;rdquo; knowledge—learning what&amp;rsquo;s needed at the moment, applying it effectively, and then moving on to the next challenge. This approach allows me to stay agile and adaptable, always ready to tackle new and complex problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;a-people-person-with-a-natural-teaching-ability&#34;&gt;A People Person with a Natural Teaching Ability&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a natural teacher. I excel at breaking down complex concepts into understandable steps. My ability to demystify technology and make it accessible has literally &lt;strong&gt;saved careers&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;my-unique-selling-point-diplomacy-with-a-dash-of-realness&#34;&gt;My Unique Selling Point: Diplomacy with a Dash of Realness&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What truly sets me apart is my combination of people skills and technical expertise. I&amp;rsquo;m diplomatic, straightforward, and committed to what&amp;rsquo;s genuinely best for my clients. I have a knack for communicating complex technical concepts in simple terms, making me a trusted advisor to those I work with. My approach is always people-first, tech-second – because at the end of the day, &lt;strong&gt;it&amp;rsquo;s not just about solving tech problems; it&amp;rsquo;s about helping people.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
